# A simple Graph-based Recommender System

### What is it?

This app is a simple graph-based recommender system that searches for items and recommends similar ones. It can be applied to any dataset. For demonstration purposes, we use the (filtered) [Goodreads](https://mengtingwan.github.io/data/goodreads#datasets) dataset.

### Where can I try this app?

The app is currently deployed at HuggingFace Spaces ([link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/eremeev-d/graph-rec)). You will probably need to wait a minute or two for app to start running. 

### How to use it?

Simply enter a keyword (e.g., "Brave") into the search bar and press the "Search" button. The app will display relevant books along with their short descriptions.

For each book, you can click "Recommend Similar Items" to see other books you might enjoy if you liked the selected one.
